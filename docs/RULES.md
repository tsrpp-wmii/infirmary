## Codebase rules:
- While merging use squash and merge
- Use CamelCase
- Avoid Trailing spaces
- Spaces>Tabs
- Do your best (modern solutions)
- Avoid overengineering
- For files use snake-case
- For loops and condition statements use Allman style
- Don't be yourself about operators order (put everywhere parentheses)
